# Rock, Paper, Scissors Demo Setup

Arduino Uno equipped with IR-sensor, wifi-module and 120x128 1.44" display  captures IR profile of rock/paper/scissor and transmits to dev server in json format.

## Rough overview of physical configuration


### Intented purpose
TODO :: Fix broken fraseing
The intention of this demo setup is to demonstrate the CREPE (tm)  "communications system" (?). The Arduino Uno will communicate the sensor data to the CREPE system, which will handle the data and communicate this further to MEAME and the biological resorvoir nuerons, intepereate the results and communicate this back to the Arduino which will display the results on a LCD display mounted on the container.   


#### Detailed overview of complete setup

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installation

"Plug an play repository. To recreate this demonstration, Download the repository and follow instructions given in comments on each source file. Upload to arduino. All code in this repository is intended to run on the Arduino.
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running"

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
